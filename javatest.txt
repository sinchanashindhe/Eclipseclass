3.What are the generalised and specilised classes in java
    the general class is  sometimes called a superclass or parent class
	the special class is sometimes called a subclass or child class
	
4.a)i dont wantmy class to be inherited by any other ckass.what should i do?
   we should not use the extend keywords
   
  b) can you give  a few examples  of final classes defined in java APL 
     java.lang.string
	 java.lang.Math are final
	 classes
	 
  c)what are some alternatives of inheritance ?
    Deligation can be alternative to inheritance .deligation means that you use an object of another class as an instance variable,and forward message to the instance   


5.which sorted collection have you used?
	java.util.collection
	
6.what is difference between Linked list and array list in java 
     LinkedList                               
* this class is uses a doubly Linked List to store its elements   
*  it is faster being node based as not much bit shifting required
*  it is implements list as well as Queue
*   it is faster in manipulation data

 ArrayList
 * this class uses as a dynamic array 
 *it is  slow as array manipulation is slower 
 *it implements only list 
 * it is faster in storing and acessing data 
 
 7. what is difference between Listiterator and iterator
    ListIterator 
* can transverse elements present in collection of both in forward and backward collection direction.
*can only traverse list and not the other two
*we can modify

Iterator
*can traverse  elements present only collection of forward direction
*helps to traverse map, list and set
*w cannot modify

 8.
 occurs when a subclass  has the same method as the parent class 
 
 9.
 A memory  Leak is   a situation  where there are objects presents in  the heap memory that are no lonher used but the garbage collection is remove them from  and therefore, unnecessarily maintained
 
10.
 static polymorphism
*a type of polymorphism that collects the informayion to call a metho during compile time
*occurs at compile time
*Excecution speed is high
* known as static binding  and early binding 

Da ynamic  polymorphism
*a type of polymorphism that collects the informayion to call a metho during run time 	
occurs at run time 
*Excecution speed is low
*known as dynamic binding  and late binding
